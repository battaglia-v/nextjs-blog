I sit here on Sunday evening reflecting on the past week - my first _full_ week as a Software Development Engineer on the Traffic Engineering, **a.k.a.** the Edge Team at Expedia Group. 

Pretty much my whole career leading up to this has been focused on Account Management - so to say that I've been eagerly awaiting working full-time as a Software Developer would be an understatement. 

In fact, leading up to this past week I've spent countless of hours of my evenings, weekends, and pretty much anywhere that I can fit in some extra time - to build my developer skill set: completing [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/12385906#overview), [Deep Dive into Modern Web Development ~ University of Helsinki](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) various courses from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), while also consuming any supplemental resources that I came across. I'm beyond excited to be putting my skills to the test in a professional environment, and to learn a ton from this vibrant and seasoned team of developers.

I decided to write this blog as a tool for me to record any learnings, a-ha moments, or general feelings on my success (and of course the inevitable failures) over the next three months. 

Coming from the sales (or partner-facing) side of the business, and diving head-first into the tech side of organization can definitely lead one to feeling a bit overwhelmed, while also full of passion and energy - as my wise engineering manager slack messaged this to me on day one - **"everything will certainly make sense eventually"**. So, I keep telling myself that it's best not to let the so-called _imposter syndrome_ take over and impede one's progress!

The biggest takeaway of my week was realizing how insanely collaborative and aligned that the Edge Team is overall. The Engineering Managers and Technical Product Manager work in tandem to ensure that the needs of the business are met, and ultimately delivered by the six **Squads** of engineers. Dividing the engineers up between these Squads allows for each to be fully focused on a universal objective - which is then broken down into individual, _bite-sized_ tasks that engineers get assigned within the squad. 

These tasks, also referred to as **stories** - give the engineer a rough idea of what needs to be accomplished, which are usually written in the form of a problem statement: _As a user of this Application, having a button on the homepage that when clicked, redirects me to my dashboard, and thus allowing me to have an improved user experience_.

The engineer then has an idea of what they will be working on, the work that needs to be finished in order for the ticket to be _done_ - and then will update their status accordingly while working through it. Having daily standup meetings within the Squads allows the engineers to discuss what they've been working on, including any major roadblocks or setbacks that needs to be addressed, or even collaborating on better ways to solve the problems that they're working on together. Being truly aligned on a single objective, to be accomplished within a six-week **sprint** - allows the team to be nimble, agile, and truly collaborative. 

I'm happy to say that I've tackled two tickets thus far, successfully sending in pull requests (or **PR's**) for both, meaning that my code fixes have been merged into the live application, passing through the development cycle: test, integration, and finally into production - live for the customer to experience the changes! They were mainly UI-related, in one case fixing a display issue to be common across the application, as well as adding a comparative operator selector for use in self-service user bot treatment configurations. 

While these may have been smaller bug fixes, it was definitely a great learning experience for me to get more familiar with the codebase, learn about the team's etiquette on how to handle PRs (and ask for PR approval in slack), remembering to include the ticket number on branch naming and commits, and even reviewing deployment logs. My prior TypeScript knowledge has certainly came in handy for these tasks! 

The third ticket/assignment that I've been assigned to is completely out of my wheelhouse (I've never worked in Java before) - but I'm eager to roll up my sleeves and tackle it! After a few setbacks this past Friday: encountering issues with my local set-up trying to run Docker and connect to the Postgre database locally - I'm determined to solve the problem statement this coming week. To many more weeks of learning, coding, collaborating, and most importantly - **"everything will certainly make sense eventually"**.
